parallel
========
This are the programs written for my Parallel and Distributed Programming course at Truman State
We used pthreads and jthreads and did 2 programms for each library
Overall it was an extremly fun class and I learned a ton. 
I did however develop tremendous appreciation for developers using parallelism 
because I realized how much debugging my code sucked
